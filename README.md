# Project 1: Data Profession Survey: Project Overview
In this Project, I have analyzed survey data from data professionals to uncover valuable insights about the data industry. These findings shed light on the satisfaction levels of data professionals with their compensation and work-life balance. One of the most interesting aspects was the favorite programming languages among data professionals, with python and R being the top choices. This Interactive Powerr BI dashboard beautifully visualizes the survey data from about 578 participants, allowing us to delve into the findings in a comprehensive way.
